BEESOFT is the software that works with BEETHEFIRST. It's open source software adapted form ReplicatorG.

ReplicatorG is an open-source GCode based controller for RepRap / CNC machines.  It has 3 main goals:

1. Be as simple to use, and as easy to install as possible.
2. Be driver oriented and abstract the GCode away, allowing users to easily create drivers for their own machine.
3. Support as much of the GCode specification as possible.
